# minipci 17-Sep-2016

Here I develop a generic PCIe driver. Idea was based on the lack of a usable driver with the Xilinx VC709 board.

* The driver should help to start own developments.
* It is planned to develop a Windows Version too. But this may take time.
* Code needs (as always) improvement
* I cannot help you in case of problems as I have no time for it
  * Asking is always an option, but don't wonder to get NO response!

## My paradigmas:

* I (try to) develop portable code
* I dislike warnings
* Code should be easy to understand

Use this code but never make me responsible for it. Use it on your own risk.
